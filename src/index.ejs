    <!-- Interactive Writing -->

    <h2 id="interactive-writing">Interactive Writing</h2>

    <p>
      Interactive articles offers unique capabilities to help people learn and engage with complex ideas that traditional media cannot support. We breakdown this collection of capabilities pulling from diverse fields of research, including human-computer interaction, information visualization, data analysis, multimedia learning, education, and data journalism, and present accompanying atomic examples that support each capability.
    </p>

    <h3 id="improving-recall">Improving Recall</h3>

    <h4>Belief elicitation</h4>
    
    <p>
      Asking a student to reflect on the material that they are studying and explain it back to themselves, a learning technique called self-explanation, is known to have a positive impact on learning outcomes [chi1989self]. By generating explanations, and refining them as new information is obtained, it is hypothesised that the student will be more engaged with the processes which they are studying [chi2000self]. When writing for an interactive environment, components can be included which prompt readers to make a prediction or reflection about the material and cause them to engage in self-explanation [kim2017explaining].
    </p>
    
    <p>
      While these prompts may take the form of text entry or other standard input widgets, one of the most prominent examples of this technique being used in practice comes from the New York Times “You Draw It” visualizations. In this case, readers are prompted to complete a trendline on a chart, causing them to generate an explanation for why they think the trend may move in a certain direction. Only after readers make their prediction are they shown the actual data. Kim et al. showed that using visualizations as a prompt is an effective way to encourage readers to engage in self explanation and improve their recall of the information.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In the case of “You Draw It,” readers were also shown the predictions that others made, adding a social element to the experience. This additional social information was not shown to necessarily be effective for improving recall [kim2017data]. However, one might hypothesize that this social aspect may have other benefits such as improving reader engagement, due to the popularity of recent visual stories using this technique, e.g. in the Pudding's "Gyllenhaal Experiment" and Quartz’s "How do you draw a circle?"
    </p>

    <h4>Retrieval Practice</h4>
    
    <p>
      Prompting readers to remember previously presented material, for example through the use of quizzes, can be an effective way to improve their ability to recall it in the future [gates1922recitation]. This result from cognitive psychology, known as the testing effect [roediger2006power], can be utilized by authors writing for an interactive medium [TK insert example?]. While testing may call to mind stressful educational experiences for many, quizzes included in web articles can be low stakes: there is no need to record the results or grade readers. The effect is enhanced if feedback is given to the quiz-takers, for example by providing the correct answer after the user has recorded their response [bangert1991instructional].
    </p>

    <p>
      The benefits of the testing effect can be further enhanced if the testing is repeated over a period of time [karpicke2008critical], assuming readers are willing to participate in the process. The idea of spaced repetition has been a popular foundation for memory building applications, for example in the Anki flash card system. More recently, authors have experimented with building spaced repetition directly into their web-based writing [cite nicky case, quantum computer], giving motivated readers the opportunity to easily opt-in to a repeated testing program over the relevant material.
    </p>


    <h3 id="improving-engagement">Improving Engagement</h3>

    <h4>Animation</h4>

    <p>
      Animation can also be used to add drama to a graphic displaying important information, but which readers may otherwise find dry. For example, Ed Hawkins designed the Climate Spiral, which shows the average global temperature change over time. This presentation of the data resonated with a large public audience, so much so that it was displayed at the opening ceremony at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
    </p>

    <p>
      By adding variation over time, authors have access to a new dimension to encode information and an even wider design space. Consider the animated graphic in the New York Times story “Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys,” which shows economic outcomes for 10,000 men who grew up in rich families. While there are many ways in which the same data could have been communicated more succinctly using a static visualization, by utilizing animation, it became possible for the authors to design a unit visualization in which each data point shown represented an individual, reminding readers that the data in this story was about real peoples’ lives.
    <p>

    <h4>Play</h4>

    <p>
      As text moves away from an author-guided narrative towards a more reader-driven one [segel2010narrative], the reading experience becomes closer to that of playing a game. [parable of the polygons]
    </p>

    <p>
      The use of games to convey information has been explored in the domains of journalism [bogost2012newsgames] and education [squire2011video]. Designers of newsgames use them to help readers build empathy with their subject (for example see FT’s Uber Game) and explain complex systems consisting of multiple parts (e.g. Cutthroat Capitalism: The Game) [cite]. In educational settings the use of games has been shown to motivate students while maintaining or improving learning outcomes [virvou2005combining].
    </p>  



    <h3 id="enabling-experience">Enabling Experience</h3>

    <h4>Animation</h4>

    <p>
      Scientific data which is inherently time varying may be shown using an animation to allow viewers to connect more closely with the original data, as compared to seeing an abstracted static view. A classic example of this is Muybridge’s motion study [muybridge1882horse]: while the series of still images may be more effective for answering specific questions like, “does a horse lift all four of its feet off the ground when it runs,” watching the animation in slow motion gives the viewer a much more visceral sense of how it runs. A more modern example can be found in OpenAI’s reporting on their hide-and-seek agents [baker2019emergent]. The animations used instantly give the viewer a sense of how the agents are operating in that environment.
    </p>

    <h4>Multiple representation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Same information represented in different forms can have different impact</l>
      <li>Accessibility (move down as a limitation?): read article, listen to article (bloomberg), watch article (video, maybe vox as example), trade-offs to each, data sonification if published in major outlet?</li>
      <li>Multimedia  Principle + Redundancy principle - people learn better from words and pictures than from words alone. The (spoken) should not be redundant with the graphics. Good example would be edu youtube videos, e.g. 3Blue1Brown or Primer </li>
      <li>Examples: politics election night coverage breaking down same outcome in multiple ways (CNN, 538, etc), hurricane path graphic alternatives (recent NYTimes alberto article)?</li>
      <li>Interactive idea: pick a meaningful statistic (climate change?): show it as a {number, number + annotation/sentence, visualization}</li>
      <li>Interactive idea: math equation v. a visualization/something visual and not notation-based</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      ^ forces you do better understand multiple abstractions of a single idea, once you know them you can show them at the same time and interact with them -> models and simulations 
    </p>

    <h4>Interactive Models and Simulations (~Interactive Documents)</h4>

    <p>
      Learning about complex systems often requires extensive setup to properly study: conducting scientific experiments, training machine learning models, modeling social phenomenon, digesting advanced mathematics, and researching recent political stories. This barrier to entry can deter people from engaging in complex topics, or explicitly prevent people who don’t have the necessary resources, e.g., computer hardware for intense machine learning tasks [kahng2018gan]. Interactive writing leverages active learning, reading combined with critical thinking [adler2014read], to drastically lower these barriers, helping diverse sets of people learn and explore using sandboxed models and simulations [victor2011explorable].
    </p>

    <p>
      Science that conducts physical and computational experiments requires systematically controlling and changing parameters to observe their effect on the modeled system. In research, dissemination is typically done through static documents, where various figures show and compare the effect of varying particular parameters. However, efforts have been made to leverage interactivity in academic publishing, summarized in [dragicevic2019increasing]. Reimagining the research paper with interactive graphics [victor2011scientific], as exploranations [ynnerman2018exploranation], or as explorable multiverse analyses [dragicevic2019increasing] gives readers control over the reporting of the research findings and shows great promise in helping readers both digest new ideas and learn about existing fields that are built upon piles of research debt [olah2017research]
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond reporting statistics, interactive writing is extremely powerful when the studied systems can be modeled or simulated in real-time with interactive parameters without setup, e.g., in-browser sandboxes. This is a driving design pattern within interactive writing, and many examples exist ranging in complexity. “How You Will Die” visually simulates the average life expectancy of different groups of people, where a reader can choose the gender, race, and age of a person [yau2016how]. “On Particle Physics” allows readers to experiment with accelerating different particles through electric and magnetic fields to build intuition behind the Lorentz force and Maxwell’s equations (foundational to the field of electromagnetism)—these experiments cannot be done without mutli-million dollar machinery [bianchi2019on]. “Should Prison Sentences Be Based On Crimes That Haven’t Been Committed Yet?” shows the outcome of calculating risk assessments for recidivism where readers adjust the thresholds for determining who gets parole [barry2015should].
    </p>

    <p>
      The proliferation of modern machine learning techniques have greatly benefited from interactive models and simulations. Two articles, “How to Use t-SNE Effectively” and “The Beginner's Guide to Dimensionality Reduction” show the effect that hyperparameters have on creating low dimensional embeddings of high-dimensional data [wattenberg2016use, conlen2018dr]. A popular approach is to demonstrate how machine learning models work with in-browser models [smilkov2019tensorflow], for example, letting readers use their own video camera as inputs to an image classification models [barron2018designing]. Other examples are aimed at technical readers who wish to learn about deep learning. Here, interfaces allow readers to choose model hyperparameters, datasets, and training procedures that, once selected, visualize the training process and model internals to inspect the effect of varying the model configuration [smilkov2017direct, kahng2018ganlab].

    </p>

    <h4>Details-on-demand</h4>

    <p>
      Authors must calibrate the detail at which to discuss ideas and content to their readers expertise and interest. When topics become multifaceted and complex, a balance must be struck between a high-level overview of a topic and its lower-level details. One ubiquitous interaction technique used to address this challenge is “details-on-demand.” Classically, from a data analysis perspective, this technique allows users to select parts of a dataset to be shown in more detail while maintaining an overview of the whole space. This is particularly useful when a change of view is not required, so that users can inspect elements of interest on a point-by-point basis in the context of the whole [craft2005beyond]. Below we highlight areas where details-on-demand has been successfully applied, including information visualizations, illustrations, mathematical notation, and text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data visualization. Details-on-demand is core to information visualization, and concludes the seminal “Visual Information-Seeking Mantra”: “Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand” [shneiderman1996eyes]. Successful visualizations not only provide the base representations and techniques for these three steps, but also bridge the gaps between them [keim2002information]. In practice, the solidified standard for details-on-demand in data visualization manifests as a tooltip, typically summoned on a cursor mouseover, that presents extra information in an overlay. Given that data often contain multiple attributes, tooltips can show the other attributes that are not currently encoded in a visualization. [Missing example, moved to personalization]
    </p>

    <p>
      Illustration. Details-on-demand is also used in illustrations, interactive textbooks, and museum exhibits, where highlighted segments of a figure can be selected to display additional information about the particular segment. For example, in “How does the eye work?” readers can select segments of an anatomical diagram of the human eye to learn more about specific regions, e.g., rods and cones [ala2018how]. Another example is Earth Primer, an interactive textbook on tablets that allows readers to inspect the Earth’s interior, surface, and biomes [gingold2015earth]. Each illustration contains segments the reader can tap to learn and explore in depth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mathematical notation. Formal mathematics, a historically static medium, can benefit from details-on-demand, for example, to elucidate a reader with intuition about a particular algebraic term or present a geometric interpretation of an equation. For example, in “Colorized Math Equations,” the Fourier Transform equation is presented in both mathematical notation and plain text, but the two are linked through a mouse over that highlights which term in the equation corresponds to which word in the text [azad2017colorized]. Another example that visualizes mathematics and computation is the “Image Kernels” tutorial where a reader can mouseover a real image and observe the effect and exact computation for applying a filter over the image. This operation, called a convolution, is at the core of convolutional neural network architectures that have recently driven machine learning progress. Instead of writing down long arithmetic sums, the interface allows readers to quickly see the summation operation’s terms and output [powell2015image].
    </p>

    <p>
      Text. While not as pervasive as other types of information, text documents and other longform textual mediums have also experimented with letting readers chose a variable level of detail to read. This idea was explored as early as the 1960s in StretchText, a hypertext feature that allows a reader to reveal a more descriptive or exhaustive explanation of something by expanding or contracting the content in place [nelson1967stretchtext]. This idea has resurfaced in recent examples, including the “On Variable Level-of-detail Documents” demo [beecroft2019on], and the call for proposals of the Parametric Press [conlen2018parametric]. One challenge that has limited its adoption is the burden it places on authors to write multiple versions of their content. For other examples of details-on-demand for text, such as application in code documentation, see this small collection of examples [basques2018ui].
    </p>

    <p>
      Previewing content. Details-on-demand can also be used as a method for previewing content without committing to another interaction. For example, when hovering over another hyperlink on Wikipedia, a preview card is shown that can contain an image and brief description; this gives readers a quick preview of the topic without clicking through and loading a new page [wikipedia2018preview]. This idea is also not new: work from human-computer interaction explored fluid links [zellweger1998fluid, zellweger2002reading] within hypertext that present information about a particular topic in a location that does not obscure the source material. Both older and modern preview techniques use perceptually-based animation and simple tooltips to ensure their interactions are natural and lightweight feeling to readers [zellweger1998fluid]. Besides these examples, details-on-demand has become a ubiquitous design pattern, from image previews when scrubbing a video, to visualizing approximate query results in big data analysis using progressive refinement [rauschenbach1998progressive, rauschenbach1999demand, moritz2017trust].
    </p>

    <h4>Interactive Models and Simulations</h4>

    <p>
      [Reduce cognitive load in presentation, ganlab?]
    </p>

    <h4>Animation</h4>

    <p>
      While there is debate amongst researchers if animations in general are able to more effectively convey the same information compared to a well designed static graphic [tversky2002animation], animation has been shown to be effective for communicating state transitions [heer2007animated], uncertainty [hullman2015hypothetical], and causality [michotte1946perception], constructing narratives [thomas1995illusion].
    </p>

    <h3 id="personalization">Personalization</h3>
    
    <h4>Personalization</h4>

    <p>
      Content personalization, automatically modifying text and multimedia based on reader’s individual features or input (e.g., demographics or location), is a technique that has been shown to increase engagement and learning within readers [cordova1996intrinsic] and support behavioral change [di2006authoring]. The PersaLog system gives developers tools to build such content and presents guidelines for personalization based on user research from practicing journalists [adar2017persalog]. Other work has shown that “personalized spatial analogies,” presenting distance measurements in regions where readers are geographically familiar with, help people more concretely understand new distance measurements within news stories [kim2016generating].
    </p>

    <p>
      Personalization alone has also been the center of interactive writing and other stories. Both “How Much Hotter Is Your Hometown Than When You Were Born?” [popovich2018how] and “Human Terrain” [daniels2018human] use location to drive stories relating to climate change and population densities respectively. Other examples ask for explicit reader input, such as a story that visualizes a reader’s net worth to challenge a reader’s assumptions if they are wealthy or not (relative to the greater population) [quealy2019are], or predicting a reader’s political party affiliation [chinoy2010quiz].
    </p>

    <h4>Details-on-demand </h4>

    <p>
      An example is the interactive scatterplot featured in “Find Out If Your Job Will Be Automated” [whitehouse2017find]. Here, professions are plotted to inspect their likelihood of being automated against their average annual wage. Since there are hundreds of professions, not every point can be labeled. Therefore, to know which points correspond to a particular profession (such as a reader wanting to find their own profession), readers can search or mouseover points to display a tooltip with the profession’s name and other information (both encoded and not) such as the level of education, the number of employees, and “computerization” rank.
    </p>

    <h4>Play/Non-linear</h4>

    <p>
      An interactive medium has the potential to offer readers an experience other than static, linear text. Non-linear stories, where an operator can choose their own path through the content, have the potential to provide a more tailored experience and focus on areas of user interest [sizemore2011interactive]. For example, the BBC has used this technique in both online articles [cite] and in a recent episode of Click [cite], a technology focused news television program. Non-linear stories present challenges for authors, as they must consider the myriad possible paths through the content, and consider the different possible experiences that the audience would have when pursuing different branches.

    <h2 id="challenges">The Challenges of Interactive Articles in Practice</h2>
    <p>
      If interactive articles provide clear benefits over other mediums for communicating complex ideas, then why aren’t there more of them? Unfortunately, creating interactive articles today is challenging for a number of different reasons. [TK make stronger, “both technically and institutionally”?]
    </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of the topic to be explained, to build an interactive article authors must have expertise in a breadth of
      skills, such as writing, design, programming, and know how to effectively combine them. Beyond that, an author must
      deeply understand a topic to communicate. Authoring interactive articles also often takes significantly more time and
      effort than a blog post or traditional academic publication.
    <p>

    <p>
      Publishing to the web brings its own challenges: while interactive articles are accessible to anyone with a browser, they are burdened by rapidly changing web technologies that could break interactive content after just a few years. For this reason, easy and accessible interactive article archival is important for authors to know their work can be confidently preserved indefinitely to support continued readership.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is also important to remember that not everything needs to be interactive. If an idea is simple enough, it may not call for interaction. However, even in a domain where the potential communication improvement is increcremental, at scale (e.g., delivering via the web), interactive articles can still have impact. [TK example to cite here?] [TK Multimedia studies actually show large effect sizes for improvement of transfer learning in many cases]
    </p>  

    <p>Besides authoring, there are other fundamental limitations for publishing interactive articles. For example, in non-journalism domains, there is a mis-aligned incentive structure for authoring and publishing interactive content: why should a researcher spend time on an “extra” interactive exposition of their work when they could instead publish more papers, a metric by which their career depends on? While different groups of people seek to maximize their work’s impact, legitimizing interactive artifacts requires buy-in from a collective of communities.</p>

    <h3>How can we help?</h3>

    <p>
      It takes a breadth of skills to author an interactive article. Can we develop new tools to help lower the barrier to entry? While there have been great, practical strides in this direction [TK idyll, apparatus, others?], there is still opportunity for creating tools to design, develop, and evaluate interactive articles in the wild. Specific features include supporting mobile-friendly adaptations of interactive graphics, creating content for different platforms besides just the web, and tools that allow people to create interactive content without code.

    </p>  

    <p>Beyond technical challenges, it is currently difficult to prototype and iterate on interactive articles. </p>

    <span class="tk">Resources from the emergent community? Or does that seem out of place?]</span>

    <h2 id="critical-reflections">Critical Reflections</h2>

    <p>
      While it has never been easier for independent writers to share their ideas online, the current generation of publishing technology mimics tools that were designed during the era of the printing press. The web offers rich dynamic capabilities, but to most authors these are off limits, residing outside the confines of restrictive content management systems. We, the authors of this article, together with a group of designers, programmers, and researchers, want to change that. To experiment with these ideas, we built The Parametric Press: a born-digital magazine dedicated to showcasing the expository power that’s possible when the interactive capabilities of dynamic media are effectively combined.
    </p>

    <p>
      In late 2018, we invited writers to respond to a call for proposals for our first issue. Issue 01: Science + Society focuses on examining scientific and technological phenomena that stand to shape society at large, now or in the near future. We sought to cover topics that would benefit from using the interactive or otherwise dynamic capabilities of the web. Given the challenges of authoring interactive articles, we did not expect authors to submit fully developed pieces. Instead, we accepted idea submissions, and worked together with those accepted to develop the issue, by offering technical, design, and editorial assistance collectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      From its inception, one of the objectives of the Parametric Press is to showcase the new forms of media and publishing that are possible with tools available today, and inspire others to create their own dynamic writings. To that end, we made available all of the software that runs the site, including reusable components, custom data visualizations, and the publishing engine itself. To address interactive content archival, we have set up a system to publish a digital archive of all of our articles at the time that they are first published to the site. We hope to show how digital works such as ours can published confidently knowing that they will be preserved indefinitely.
    </p>

      What we would like to see, call for action
      Predicated on do these actual people learn? Evaluation is largely absent (sans Matt’s eurovis 2019 paper, scrolly v. stepping, sequence based mediums)
      
      More tools that make these easier to create
      
      More platforms/venues
      
      VISxAI 2019 (maybe mention but not needed?)
      
      Distill
      
      Parametric
      
      Clearer paths to submission for existing publications, standards and guidelines
      
      E.g. news outlets have clear instructions for pitching written pieces, less so for interactive ones Funding
