        "description": "Conducting novel research requires deep understanding and expertise in a specific area. Once achieved, researchers continue contributing new knowledge for future researchers to use and build upon. Over time, this consistent addition of new knowledge can build up, contributing to what some have called research debt. Not everyone is an expert in every field, and it can be easy to lose perspective and forget the bigger picture. Yet research should be understood by many. Interactive articles can be used to distill the latest progress in various research fields and make their methods and results accessible and understandable to a broader audience.",
